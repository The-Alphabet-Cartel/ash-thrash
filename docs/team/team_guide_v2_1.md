## 🧠 Understanding Crisis Detection Testing

### Why Testing Matters

**Community Safety Depends on Accuracy:**
- **False Negatives (Missing Real Crises):** Someone in genuine distress doesn't get help
- **False Positives (Alerting When Not Needed):** Team burnout and reduced trust in the system
- **Context Sensitivity:** Understanding LGBTQIA+ community language and expressions

**What We Test:**
1. **Immediate Crisis (Priority 1)** - Active suicidal ideation, immediate danger
2. **High Risk (Priority 2)** - Severe depression with concerning indicators
3. **Medium Risk (Priority 3)** - Notable emotional distress requiring check-in
4. **Low Risk (Priority 4)** - Minor concerns, gentle support needed
5. **General Support (Priority 5)** - Everyday community support situations
6. **False Positives** - Phrases that should NOT trigger crisis alerts
7. **Community Specific** - LGBTQIA+ context and terminology understanding

### How Testing Works

**Real-World Validation:**
- Test phrases based on actual community language patterns
- Scenarios drawn from crisis response experience
- Regular updates based on community feedback
- Continuous improvement of detection accuracy

**Example Test Categories:**
```
Immediate Crisis: "I can't take this anymore, I'm done with everything"
High Risk: "Every day feels impossible, I don't see a way forward"
Medium Risk: "Having a really rough week, everything feels overwhelming"
Low Risk: "Feeling a bit down today, could use some positive vibes"
False Positive: "This game boss is making me want to die" (gaming context)
Community: "Struggling with my identity after coming out to family"
```

## 🚨 Alert Response Procedures

### Understanding System Alerts

**Alert Types:**
1. **Test Failure Alerts** - Testing system detected accuracy problems
2. **System Health Alerts** - Technical issues with Ash or NLP server
3. **Performance Alerts** - System running slower than expected
4. **Connectivity Alerts** - Communication problems between components

### Alert Response Workflow

**Level 1: Test Failure Alert**
```
Alert: "High Risk category success rate dropped to 78%"

Response Steps:
1. Check #tech-support for known issues
2. Review recent test results in dashboard
3. Verify NLP server connectivity
4. If persistent, escalate to Technical Team
5. Increase manual monitoring temporarily
```

**Level 2: System Health Alert**
```
Alert: "Ash-Thrash cannot connect to NLP server"

Response Steps:
1. Immediate: Post in #crisis-response channel
2. Technical: Tag @Technical Team in Discord
3. Manual: Increase manual crisis monitoring
4. Communication: Inform team about reduced automated support
5. Follow-up: Monitor for resolution confirmation
```

**Level 3: Critical System Failure**
```
Alert: "Crisis detection system completely down"

Response Steps:
1. IMMEDIATE: Post in #crisis-response with @everyone
2. ESCALATE: Direct message Technical Lead
3. MANUAL MODE: Switch to full manual crisis monitoring
4. COMMUNICATION: Inform all team members of manual procedures
5. DOCUMENTATION: Track all crisis situations manually until restored
```

### Manual Monitoring Procedures

**When to Activate Manual Mode:**
- System alerts indicate poor detection accuracy
- Technical issues prevent automated monitoring
- Major system updates or maintenance
- High-stress community events (special occasions, world events)

**Manual Monitoring Process:**
1. **Assign Watchers:** Dedicated team members monitor specific channels
2. **Check-in Schedule:** Regular status updates in team coordination channel
3. **Documentation:** Manual log of any crisis situations encountered
4. **Escalation:** Direct coordination for crisis response without automated alerts
5. **Recovery:** Gradual return to automated monitoring after system validation
